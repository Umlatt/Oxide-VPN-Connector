# Oxide-VPN-Connector
A project to enable customers to use a custom VPN to stretch their private network.

This project is designed to work with a Jelastic based platform.

It requires a custom network bridge created on the node/s where the containers/vms will run as well as an IP address which contains the VPN services.
